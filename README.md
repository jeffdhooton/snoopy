# Snoopy - SEO First Page Rank Checking

CLI tool that takes in either a query & url or a csv and determines whether or not you have a first page ranking for it.

## Flags

1. **`-query`**: The search query for a single run
1. **`-url`**: The domain that you want to check for (example.com)
1. **`-file`**: Runs a csv through the checks, example csv structure provided at input.csv
